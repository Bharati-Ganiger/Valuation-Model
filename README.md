# Valuation-Model
DCF valuation, financial projections, sensitivity analysis, and valuation insights

This project demonstrates a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation model built to estimate the intrinsic value of a company based on projected cash flows, terminal value, and cost of capital assumptions. The model is supported by a dynamic Excel dashboard to enable quick analysis and decision-making.
